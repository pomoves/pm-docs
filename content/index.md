The [Pomodoro Technique][1] is well known for helping us improve focus and performance throughout the day, but what are you doing with those short breaks? Are you getting the most out of them?

Instead of just checking your social networks, news, etc. What if you just get out of that chair and get moving? Let your blood flow, refresh your brain, breathe... So that when you get back, you are strong and ready to **Get Things Done**.

[Pomoves][2] is a simple to use Pomodoro timer that will connect to your [Google Fit][3] profile, and will allow you to keep track of how much you move during breaks. If you're not doing this now, you will be surprise how much of a difference those 5 minute breaks will make when you add them all up.

### Here is a simple example:

With a goal of 12 Pomodoros per day, you get 9 Short Breaks (5 min) + 2 Long Breaks (15 min), that would be:

- 9 x  5 min = 45 min
- 2 x 15 min = 30 min

For a total of **75 minutes moving!**

That means you can easily beat your fitness goal of 1 active hour per day.

### How does it translate to calories?

For an average person weighing 155 pounds, those 75 minutes translate to:

- Sitting ~ 110 calories
- Standing ~ 120 calories
- **Walking (3.5 mph) ~ 375 calories!!**

So it's all up to you, get even better than what you are today, and [Pomoves][2] will help you keep track of it.
